#copy a file from your local system to remote host
#webserver is host group name from inventory
#task will be executed on remote host as the same user as that on local host
#Eg: if u execute this yaml on local host as user123, on the remote host also it will be copied as user123.
#if proper login for user123 to remote host are not available, then add steps for that also.
